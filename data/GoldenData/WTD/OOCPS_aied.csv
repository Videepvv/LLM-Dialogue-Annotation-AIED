161,Group_01_161,Group_01,538.17,541.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,161,538.17,541.44,1,1,God yeah balances is hard I mean
162,Group_01_162,Group_01,539.83,540.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,162,539.83,540.22,1,2,Yeah

164,Group_01_164,Group_01,546.21,554.52,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,164,546.21,554.52,1,1,This or this cause we can't even make these weights so it could be above them I know but like if we are thinking it's so close to a hundred
165,Group_01_165,Group_01,549.41,550.5,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,165,549.41,550.5,1,3,That could be part of it
166,Group_01_166,Group_01,555.57,559.58,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,166,555.57,559.58,1,1,Are probably errors within yeah within this
167,Group_01_167,Group_01,557.58,558.66,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,167,557.58,558.66,1,3,Twenty

172,Group_01_172,Group_01,574.92,576.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,172,574.92,576.9,1,1,Yeah

221,Group_02_2,Group_02,18.75,23.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,18.75,23.1,2,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weight of these five cubes
222,Group_02_3,Group_02,23.52,32.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,23.52,32.73,2,4,And we can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams yep and you're going you're going to flip the piece of paper um
223,Group_02_4,Group_02,27.15,28.38,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,27.15,28.38,2,2,Can we use this piece of paper
224,Group_02_5,Group_02,33.3,36.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,33.3,36.42,2,4,You are going to determine the rest of the weights using them
225,Group_02_6,Group_02,36.45,38.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,36.45,38.76,2,4,Using the scale um
226,Group_02_7,Group_02,39.48,45.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,39.48,45.21,2,4,And you don't need to use the slider on the scale just like round up to whatever like zero so you don't have to worry about like 23
227,Group_02_8,Group_02,46.83,54.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,46.83,54.78,2,4,Um and then go ahead and place the scale on the worksheet when you've gotten the weight and also enter it into this survey
228,Group_02_9,Group_02,54.9,57.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,54.9,57.3,2,4,You guys are going to be group two
229,Group_02_10,Group_02,57.63,58.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,57.63,58.83,2,4,And you can go ahead and start
230,Group_02_11,Group_02,59.58,65.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,59.58,65.92,2,2,Alright you guys mind if I just start some tests
231,Group_02_12,Group_02,60.84,68.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,60.84,68.01,3,1,Ok cool no for sure

233,Group_02_14,Group_02,86.82,88.95,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,86.82,88.95,2,1,So I would imagine if this
234,Group_02_15,Group_02,88.98,91.58,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,88.98,91.58,2,1,Needle goes over the red line that means they're probably equal
235,Group_02_16,Group_02,92.58,94.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,92.58,94.65,2,2,And I I think they are
236,Group_02_17,Group_02,94.77,97.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,94.77,97.05,2,2,Especially since it keeps going back in a
237,Group_02_18,Group_02,97.11,102.39,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,97.11,102.39,2,1,Yeah they also just look like relatively the same size but they could be different material you know
238,Group_02_19,Group_02,97.37,98.25,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,97.37,98.25,2,2,Even length
239,Group_02_20,Group_02,104.08,106.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,104.08,106.23,2,1,So that one is probably ten grams too
240,Group_02_21,Group_02,102.45,104.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,102.45,104.75,2,2,Yeah
241,Group_02_22,Group_02,108.06,111.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,108.06,111.3,2,1,And then if that's ten grams then we have a two
242,Group_02_23,Group_02,112.29,117.87,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,112.29,117.87,2,2,So I'm going to hold back on that one because I think it's the heaviest
243,Group_02_24,Group_02,115.73,116.17,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,115.73,116.17,2,1,Yeah
244,Group_02_25,Group_02,119.13,120.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,119.13,120.16,2,1,We can do like the
245,Group_02_26,Group_02,120.5,121.59,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,26,120.5,121.59,2,2,The green one
246,Group_02_27,Group_02,121.74,123.9,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,121.74,123.9,2,2,By touch feels lighter
247,Group_02_28,Group_02,124.68,127.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28,124.68,127.02,2,2,And that looks like it might be about even
248,Group_02_29,Group_02,133.83,136.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29,133.83,136.17,2,1,Ok
249,Group_02_30,Group_02,138.0,140.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,30,138.0,140.31,2,1,There we go that's better
250,Group_02_31,Group_02,141.27,146.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31,141.27,146.91,2,2,Well on the first go through I noticed how it bounced twice and actually get some momentum ok so then
251,Group_02_32,Group_02,144.92,149.08,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,32,144.92,149.08,2,1,Yeah so that's probably twenty grams
252,Group_02_33,Group_02,149.97,151.95,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,149.97,151.95,2,1,You'd imagine and then
253,Group_02_34,Group_02,152.31,153.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,152.31,153.75,2,1,The first two are ten
254,Group_02_35,Group_02,154.58,155.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,154.58,155.34,2,2,Yep
255,Group_02_36,Group_02,155.49,158.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,36,155.49,158.1,2,2,Um
256,Group_02_37,Group_02,158.13,164.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,37,158.13,164.17,2,2,So knowing that uh oh sorry the green one was yeah
257,Group_02_38,Group_02,164.31,165.67,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,38,164.31,165.67,2,1,Twenty probably
258,Group_02_39,Group_02,165.56,166.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39,165.56,166.59,2,3,Yeah
259,Group_02_40,Group_02,167.13,169.11,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40,167.13,169.11,2,3,This is what we are looking at next
260,Group_02_41,Group_02,169.26,171.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41,169.26,171.42,2,2,Yeah
261,Group_02_42,Group_02,192.69,195.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42,192.69,195.87,2,1,So you know twenty plus ten thirty probably
262,Group_02_43,Group_02,195.93,199.5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43,195.93,199.5,2,2,Yeah but it still feels like it's leaning towards the two blocks
263,Group_02_44,Group_02,199.75,200.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,44,199.75,200.82,2,1,Oh yeah it does
264,Group_02_45,Group_02,216.87,220.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45,216.87,220.01,2,1,I guess it's leveling out a bit more but
265,Group_02_46,Group_02,220.25,221.25,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,46,220.25,221.25,2,2,Yeah

267,Group_02_48,Group_02,222.5,227.46,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,222.5,227.46,2,1,Yeah yeah closest like
268,Group_02_49,Group_02,227.7,230.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,49,227.7,230.91,2,1,Accuracy wise so then you know
269,Group_02_50,Group_02,231.42,233.46,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,231.42,233.46,2,1,You can do the same process with

344,Group_02_125,Group_02,567.03,569.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,125,567.03,569.85,2,1,So we can try and
345,Group_02_126,Group_02,580.53,583.02,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,126,580.53,583.02,2,1,I don't know it's probably better if the same hand
346,Group_02_127,Group_02,583.92,585.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,127,583.92,585.9,2,2,Yeah

348,Group_02_129,Group_02,590.79,591.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,129,590.79,591.33,2,1,I don't know I mean
349,Group_02_130,Group_02,595.0,597.51,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,130,595.0,597.51,2,3,Wait what it it again when it's lined up
350,Group_02_131,Group_02,598.75,602.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,131,598.75,602.55,2,2,That's a ten ten that's a twenty
351,Group_02_132,Group_02,597.9,599.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,132,597.9,599.5,2,1,Um think yeah these are ten
352,Group_02_133,Group_02,602.91,604.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,133,602.91,604.98,2,2,Fifty and that's a thirty
353,Group_02_134,Group_02,607.98,612.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,134,607.98,612.63,2,2,And we guessed this was a one forty so our options were one thirty or
354,Group_02_135,Group_02,612.75,614.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,135,612.75,614.73,2,2,Off the paper
355,Group_02_136,Group_02,616.02,618.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,136,616.02,618.0,2,2,Together that's one twenty
356,Group_02_137,Group_02,623.01,624.9,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,137,623.01,624.9,2,3,I think it has to do with patterns
357,Group_02_138,Group_02,619.95,623.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,138,619.95,623.34,2,2,Um personally 
358,Group_02_139,Group_02,625.26,629.07,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,139,625.26,629.07,2,3,Because it says think about the relationship between the weights of the power blocks
359,Group_02_140,Group_02,629.67,632.49,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,140,629.67,632.49,2,3,And if you do like
360,Group_02_141,Group_02,629.58,630.03,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,141,629.58,630.03,2,2,Oh yeah
361,Group_02_142,Group_02,637.71,639.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,142,637.71,639.99,2,3,These add up to twenty
362,Group_02_143,Group_02,640.29,642.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,143,640.29,642.9,2,3,These add up to thirty these add up to fifty
363,Group_02_144,Group_02,644.79,647.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,144,644.79,647.37,2,3,But that doesn't really make sense either I don't know
364,Group_02_145,Group_02,647.49,649.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,145,647.49,649.47,2,1,Yeah I mean this could be
365,Group_02_146,Group_02,649.98,655.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,146,649.98,655.71,2,1,This set of two adds up to this one and then the next set of two adds up to that
366,Group_02_147,Group_02,655.86,661.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,147,655.86,661.77,2,2,So these would add up to eighty and then eighty plus fifty would be one thirty
367,Group_02_148,Group_02,656.5,658.58,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,656.5,658.58,2,3,So it would be eighty and you weigh less
368,Group_02_149,Group_02,664.32,666.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,149,664.32,666.3,2,3,And thirty

370,Group_02_151,Group_02,677.25,680.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,151,677.25,680.28,2,3,I think it just feels like it's
371,Group_02_152,Group_02,680.52,684.83,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,152,680.52,684.83,2,3,A lot heavier because it's denser and like just carrying that
372,Group_02_153,Group_02,682.33,683.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,153,682.33,683.66,2,1,Yeah that might makes sense
373,Group_02_154,Group_02,684.83,686.01,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,154,684.83,686.01,2,2,Were we right then

375,Group_02_156,Group_02,689.13,690.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,156,689.13,690.47,2,3,Cause I think we did one step too much
376,Group_02_157,Group_02,689.58,671.17,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,157,689.58,691.17,2,1,Yeah it's a pattern
377,Group_02_158,Group_02,691.9,692.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,158,691.9,692.04,2,2,Really

381,Group_02_162,Group_02,708.83,715.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,162,708.83,715.11,2,4,Ok for the final part of the task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the
382,Group_02_163,Group_02,715.23,719.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,163,715.23,719.25,2,4,Second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer
383,Group_02_164,Group_02,726.81,730.89,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,164,726.81,730.89,2,3,Well that was our one thirty right because that was fifty

387,Group_02_168,Group_02,747.78,753.15,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,168,747.78,753.15,2,1,The like sum of the two previous blocks
388,Group_02_169,Group_02,760.68,763.32,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,169,760.68,763.32,2,3,In order to like

1008,Group_05_152,Group_05,580.02,583.5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,152,580.02,583.5,5,1,It was not quite correct no alright alright
1009,Group_05_153,Group_05,598.89,613.17,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,153,598.89,613.17,5,3,This is so no no it gets this plus this equals this this plus this equals this this plus this is or this plus this yeah so we're thinking eighty
1010,Group_05_154,Group_05,598.68,609.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,154,598.68,609.5,5,1,These are the same this is a difference of ten is this a difference of fifty no it is these and this
1011,Group_05_155,Group_05,608.67,613.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,155,608.67,613.02,5,2,So this plus this equals this 
1012,Group_05_156,Group_05,613.26,616.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,156,613.26,616.26,5,1,Yeah I mean that makes sense it would move here
1013,Group_05_157,Group_05,616.73,630.58,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,157,616.73,630.58,5,2,I mean we can we can I guess we could feel it ok you know what this does feel pretty close I think maybe the distrubtuion just messed us up
1014,Group_05_158,Group_05,619.75,623.5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,158,619.75,623.5,5,3,That's weird that or are we sure that purple is still twenty
1015,Group_05_159,Group_05,616.62,630.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,159,616.62,630.69,5,1,I mean it's green so it makes sense yeah because we got the answer wrong yeah maybe
1016,Group_05_160,Group_05,634.2,637.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,160,634.2,637.02,5,2,If I hold these together more
1017,Group_05_161,Group_05,638.35,646.71,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,161,638.35,646.71,5,2,I think it's just hard cause these are these two are like separate so it feels different I don't know I I it's hard to tell
1018,Group_05_162,Group_05,647.35,648.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,162,647.35,648.09,5,1,That makes sense

1021,Group_05_165,Group_05,658.88,671.13,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,165,658.88,671.13,5,3,I'm trying to do randomization without here spin them for me yep put them right between my fingers

1023,Group_05_167,Group_05,674.25,677.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,167,674.25,677.01,5,2,I'm going to grab both of these by the base
1024,Group_05_168,Group_05,682.74,688.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,168,682.74,688.91,5,1,Ok let's go with that let's go with eighty yeah
1025,Group_05_169,Group_05,683.88,689.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,169,683.88,689.4,5,3,I'm not great at handheld weighting cool

1027,Group_05_171,Group_05,692.01,709.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,171,692.01,709.08,5,1,Eighty grams alright cool next ok
1028,Group_05_172,Group_05,692.31,698.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,172,692.31,698.84,5,3,Eighty nice next
1029,Group_05_173,Group_05,715.34,718.32,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,173,715.34,718.32,5,3,The factory that creates the wooden blocks did not send us the second mystery block
1030,Group_05_174,Group_05,712.38,714.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,174,712.38,714.01,5,1,Go ahead and read it I can't read it from here
1031,Group_05_175,Group_05,718.35,729.51,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,175,718.35,729.51,5,3,You have two oppurtunities to estimate the weight of the second block explain in one to two sentences how you determined your estimate indicate the weight of the second mystery block yep
1032,Group_05_176,Group_05,726.64,728.76,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,176,726.64,728.76,5,1,If we decide to continue on the pattern
1033,Group_05_177,Group_05,729.78,732.81,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,177,729.78,732.81,5,1,One thirty weight makes sense
1034,Group_05_178,Group_05,732.99,735.48,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,178,732.99,735.48,5,3,So the pattern is
1035,Group_05_179,Group_05,736.53,750.69,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,179,736.53,750.69,5,1,The summation of the previous two which actually makes sense because this ten plus 0 is ten ten plus ten is twenty well yeah but yeah
1036,Group_05_180,Group_05,745.75,747.75,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,180,745.75,747.75,5,2,So we're thinking it's like the Fibonacci series then  
1037,Group_05_181,Group_05,737.93,749.78,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,181,737.93,749.78,5,3,Of the previous two oh sure yeah pretty much it's the same idea
1038,Group_05_182,Group_05,751.86,757.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,182,751.86,757.84,5,3,It is actually one one two three five eight one three so you're right it is literally the fibonacci 
1039,Group_05_183,Group_05,754.67,761.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,183,754.67,761.42,5,1,One one yeah it is the fibonacci ok so go with that we're thinking one thirty
1040,Group_05_184,Group_05,763.08,764.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,184,763.08,764.7,5,2,One thirty because
1041,Group_05_185,Group_05,764.85,768.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,185,764.85,768.15,5,1,Yeah go ahead and explain it how you think
1042,Group_05_186,Group_05,784.62,796.74,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,186,784.62,796.74,5,2,It's weird because these all together still feels light because you like yeah I think you understand its different blocks or this doesn't feel heavy but when have one small thing that's the weight of all of that it feels heavier that's the weird thing
1043,Group_05_187,Group_05,800.13,805.01,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,187,800.13,805.01,5,3,How do you spell Fibonacci F I B O N A C C I

1052,Group_05_196,Group_05,866.52,871.67,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,196,866.52,871.67,5,1,Did you do the wrong button oh there you go it saved it

1054,Group_05_198,Group_05,890.34,900.78,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,198,890.34,900.78,5,3,Equals prior heaviest block plus the one before that so now the equation is mystery block two equals eighty gram plus fifty gram equals one thirty gram cool
1055,Group_05_199,Group_05,894.52,903.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,199,894.52,903.69,5,2,So this one yeah sounds good

1065,Group_06_5,Group_06,31.35,38.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,31.35,38.25,6,4,Um the scale like is a little bit finnicky but like as long as it doesn't drop down it's probably good like you can see right now it's
1066,Group_06_6,Group_06,39.75,47.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,39.75,47.55,6,4,Um so as you work through the tasks if you can place the cubes on the sheet where they go and also fill out the survey
1067,Group_06_7,Group_06,47.82,50.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,47.82,50.79,6,4,Um that is on this computer

1089,Group_06_29,Group_06,131.79,132.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29,131.79,132.58,6,1,Yeah it looks a little
1090,Group_06_30,Group_06,136.44,141.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,136.44,141.09,6,2,Cause it um just that one there
1091,Group_06_31,Group_06,137.36,138.33,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31,137.36,138.33,6,3,Is this one a twenty

1093,Group_06_33,Group_06,148.2,150.18,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,148.2,150.18,6,2,It's so sensitive

1859,Group_08_120,Group_08,384.3,391.84,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,120,384.3,391.84,8,1,Is there any mystery block third weight
1860,Group_08_121,Group_08,394.23,395.01,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,121,394.23,395.01,8,2,Nice

1862,Group_08_123,Group_08,399.92,405.01,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,123,399.92,405.01,8,3,Ok so it might have to do with the numbers and stuff but
1863,Group_08_124,Group_08,399.27,399.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,124,399.27,399.75,8,4,And you can now begin
1864,Group_08_125,Group_08,402.01,405.57,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,125,402.01,405.57,8,1,It's like um
1865,Group_08_126,Group_08,405.84,406.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,126,405.84,406.82,8,3,Either that or we could just
1866,Group_08_127,Group_08,406.75,410.1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,127,406.75,410.1,8,1,I think it's for data reference I don't know
1867,Group_08_128,Group_08,410.79,413.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,128,410.79,413.64,8,3,Pretty heavy so let's read the numbers to see if we can
1868,Group_08_129,Group_08,413.82,415.8,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,129,413.82,415.8,8,3,Notice a pattern
1869,Group_08_130,Group_08,417.48,421.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,130,417.48,421.38,8,2,Interesting I was definitely right yeah it's definitely

1872,Group_08_133,Group_08,432.59,438.81,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,133,432.59,438.81,8,1,Actually since the like the density is different we can't actually compare directly
1873,Group_08_134,Group_08,429.96,431.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,134,429.96,431.08,8,2,To see you know how to

2002,Group_08_263,Group_08,964.26,968.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,263,964.26,968.61,8,1,When you add thirty plus twenty we get fifty when you add fifty plus thirty we get eighty
2003,Group_08_264,Group_08,968.73,971.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,264,968.73,971.31,8,1,When we add eighty plus fifty we get one thirty

2005,Group_08_266,Group_08,972.42,973.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,266,972.42,973.67,8,3,Oh gotcha

2015,Group_08_276,Group_08,1009.05,1016.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,276,1009.05,1016.07,8,1,Actually the blocks start with the sequence of ten plus ten twenty twenty plus ten thirty you can explain that
2016,Group_08_277,Group_08,1020.51,1027.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,277,1020.51,1027.83,8,3,Yeah but there's a name for the sequence I mean you can write that out I just want to keep trying to think of the name because that would be probably easier
2017,Group_08_278,Group_08,1030.92,1033.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,278,1030.92,1033.26,8,2,Once

2337,Group_10_172,Group_10,589.42,601.34,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,172,589.42,601.34,10,2,No no no no so the thing is like when you put this it feels almost same because it's just ten gram difference that's why Let let's try it Yeah
2338,Group_10_173,Group_10,596.5,603.02,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,173,596.5,603.02,10,3,So that that would put it at like a hundred Because that one would be a hundred and ten and this is a hundred ten so that's hundred
2339,Group_10_174,Group_10,601.75,604.25,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,174,601.75,604.25,10,1,I mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess

2343,Group_10_178,Group_10,615.14,627.57,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,178,615.14,627.57,10,2,No wait wait this is hundred this is hundred this is hundred So means hundred and ten is total this Yeah Okay yeah sure sure sure
